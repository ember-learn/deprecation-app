Ember provides [ember-2-legacy](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-2-legacy) which is an addon to help
app with deprecations during the transition from the 2.x series to 3.x. This addon provides app owners more
time to upgrade off of the deprecations slated for removal in 3.0.0 and depcouples that work from
upgrading to the 3.x series.

This addon will be supported until 3.4 at which point it will be deprecated.

Once you have removed all deprecations, you can remove the addon with the command:
`npm uninstall ember-2-legacy`
