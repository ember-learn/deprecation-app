title: Ember.Map, Ember.MapWithDefault, and Ember.OrderedSet are deprecated
until: '2.16.0'
since: '2.13'
---

The private classes `Ember.Map`, `Ember.MapWithDefault`, and `Ember.OrderedSet`
are being deprecated and will be removed in a later version of Ember.

Developers using any of these classes should replace them by a custom
implementation.
