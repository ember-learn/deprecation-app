title: import Ember from 'ember'
until: 7.0.0
since: 6.5.0
---

`import Ember from 'ember';` is deprecated. APIs that were previously accessed 
via `Ember` should be imported directly from their respective packages.

This was introduced in [RFC #1003](https://rfcs.emberjs.com/id/1003-deprecation-import-ember-from-ember).
