title: Ember.ControllerMixin
until: 6.0.0
since: 5.10.0

Previously, `ControllerMixin` could be accessed via the `Ember` import:
```js
import Ember from 'ember';

Ember.ControllerMixin
```
`ControllerMixin` is also private.

If needed, `ControllerMixin` can be imported:
```js
import { ControllerMixin } from '@ember/controller';
```

However, due to `ControllerMixin` being private, it is not recommended, nor supported.
