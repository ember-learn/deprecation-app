title: Ember.Enumerable
until: 6.0.0
since: 5.10.0

Previously, Enumerable could be accessed via the `Ember` import:
```js
import Ember from 'ember';

Ember.Enumerable
```
Enumerable is also private.

 If needed, Enumerable can be imported:
```js
import Enumerable from '@ember/enumerable';
```

However, due to Enumerable being private, it is not recommended, nor supported.
