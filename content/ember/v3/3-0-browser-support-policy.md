Ember's browser support policy is changing in v4.0. We will no longer support IE11, and instead will have a new support matrix including the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari

To see more details about the policy and which versions of these browsers are supported, see the [new documentation](http://emberjs.com/browser-support). To prepare for this, you should remove `IE 11` from the list of browsers in your targets, and update it to match your organization's support policy.
