Any component managers using the `3.4` capabilities should update to the most
recent component capabilities that are available, currently `3.13`. In `3.13`,
the only major change is that update hooks are no longer called by default. If
you need update hooks, use the `updateHook` capability:

```js
capabilities({
  updateHook: true,
});
```
