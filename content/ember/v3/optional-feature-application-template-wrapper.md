Setting the `application-template-wrapper` optional feature to `true` has been
deprecated. You must set this feature to `false`, disabling the application
wrapper. For more details on this optional feature, including the changes in
behavior disabling it causes and how you can disable it, see the
[optional features section](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/configuring-ember/optional-features/#toc_application-template-wrapper)
of the Ember guides. You can also run `npx @ember/octanify` to set this feature
to the correct value.
