title: "@ember/error Package"
until: 5.0.0
since: 4.10.0

Use of `@ember/error` is deprecated. This package merely re-exports the native Error class. You should replace any uses of `@ember/error` with the native `Error`.

Before:
``` javascript
import EmberError from '@ember/error';

throw new EmberError("My Error");
```

After:
``` javascript
throw new Error("My Error");
```

The `ember-error-codemod` may be used to resolve this issue:

``` shell
npx ember-error-codemod remove path/of/files/ or/some**/*glob.js
```
