title: Using `TrackedArray` or `SubArray`
until: 2.0.0
since: 1.13.0
---


`TrackedArray` and `SubArray` were internal classes used as implementation
details of `ArrayComputed`.  `ArrayComputed` is deprecated to be removed
in version 2.0.0.  As a result, these 2 private classes will be removed as
well.
