The `in` syntax is used to name an iterated value with `{{each}}`. Block
params, introduced Ember 1.10, obsoletes the `in` syntax.

Each helpers should be updated to use block params. For example this helper:

```handlebars
{{#each foo in bar}}
```

Can be converted as follows:

```handlebars
{{#each bar as |foo|}}
```
For "itemController" :

```handlebars
{{#each foo in bar itemController="abc"}}
```
Can be converted as follows:

```handlebars
{{#each bar itemController="abc" as |foo|}}
```
