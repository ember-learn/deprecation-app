`EnumerableUtils` has been deprecated in favor of native implementations. You can consult the
[JavaScript Array documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
to find suitable replacements for `EnumerableUtils` functionality.
If the native JavaScript array object does not provide a suitable equivalent for your needs, you might also want to checkout
third party utility libraries like [lodash](https://lodash.com/), or [underscore](underscorejs.org/).
